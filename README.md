# Personal Portfolio Website
This repo contains the source code for my personal website. I had a lot of fun in using new React along with new libraries that I hadn't used before.
### Key Tools used
- JavaScript and React
- Gatsby
- styled-components

### What went well?
I really liked being able to learn how to use styled components as well as use Gatsby. I found that both didn't have a huge learning curve, and was able to get the hang of them quickly. I think that perhaps Gatsby wasn't necessary for this website, but I wanted to practice using it, as I believe it will be helpful in larger, more complex websites. Additionally, I think I styled-components has become my preferred method for styling react components. Having styles contained within specific react components felt highly intuitive and much easier to manage than class names in CSS.

Additionally, I practiced using the Atomic Design system, which categorizes UI elements into atoms, molecules (groups of atoms), and organisms (groups of molecules). Since this application is only one page, I skipped the "layouts" taxonomy, but instead used organisms as parts of the final page. This design system also felt intuitive to me, and helped me know when to reuse or abstract a component. I will definitely be using this design system in the future.

### What challenges did you encounter?
I think the biggest challenge I encountered at the beginning was not planning ahead on component design. At first, I didn't really have a structure in place for how I would organize my components. By researching different design systems, I was able to implement atomic design to fix that problem. Besides that, I think my biggest mistake in this project was not using TypeScript. I believe this would have helped me a lot in passing props and avoiding confusion within and between components.

### Where will you go next with this project?
There are 2 categories of improvements to make:
##### 1. Before publishing
There are improvements I want to make before buying a domain and pushing it onto the internet.
- Making the contact page fully functional
- Making the site mobile compatible: I definitely need to alter the structure and styling of the website for mobile. Although I attempted to design for any screen size, there are some aspects of the site that need to be looked over again in order to allow the website to look great on mobile too.
##### 2. After publishing
There are also improvements that can be made post production and far into the future. Although it is important to have a polished product, the benefits of having a personal website outweigh the improvements to be made at this point.
- Adding animations to components loading and on initial startup
- Adding more interesting visual details

### Final Word
Thank you for taking the time to read about my website. I hope this information illustrated my thought process throughout the building of this project. I am quite proud of the work I did on this, especially since most of my JavaScript and React knowledge came from non-academic or self-taught sources.
