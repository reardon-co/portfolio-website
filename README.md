# Personal Portfolio Website
This repo contains the source code for my personal website. I had a lot of fun in using new React along with new libraries that I hadn't used before.
### Key Tools used
- JavaScript and React
- Gatsby
- styled-components

### What went well?
I really liked being able to learn how to use styled components as well as use Gatsby. I found that both didn't have a huge learning curve, and was able to get the hang of them quikcly. I think that perhaps Gatsby wasn't necessary for this website, but I wanted to practice using it, as I believe it will be helpful in larger, more complex wesbites. Additionally, I think I styled-components has become my preferred method for styling react components. Having styles contained within specific react components felt highly intuitive and much easier to manage than class names in CSS.

Additionally, I practiced using the Atomic Design system, which categorizes UI elements into atoms, molecules (groups of atoms), and organisms (groups of molecules). Since this application is only one page, I skipped the "layouts" taxonomy, but instead used organisms as parts of the final page. This design system also felt intuitive to me, and helped me know when to reuse or abstract components. I will definitely be using this design system in the future.
